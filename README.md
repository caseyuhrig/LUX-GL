# OpenGL
C++ OpenGL project to build a 3D simulator (sandbox) for physics based experiments and create mathematical art.

This project to NOT a game engine :)  Not that creating a 3D character and shooting at him won't happen!

The goal is a 3D simulator with a physics engine (@bulletphysics) that can be used with machine learning experiments.  Like training 
a 3D character to walk in Python, then connecting the Python program with this C++ OpenGL simulator/visualizer to watch as it learns and/or
to run the trained model after the fact.  It will do more, but that's the end goal for this project.

Here are some of the resourses I've been using and API's.
